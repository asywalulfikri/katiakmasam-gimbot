#Simple-Brick-Games

You can find screenshots for phones [here](./screenshots)

This is litteraly my first Android app and even my first greater project. So please have sympathy that my code style isn't the best. 
I already made some improvements, but I don't want to put too much time in that.

I tried to make it easy to add more subgames in this app.

Here is my Google Play description:

This is my first app and it's a simple game!

Do you remember the classic "Bricks Games" from the 90's? No? Anyway, you can get retro feelings with this game!

Now with 14 unique mini games inspired by the original brick games :D

Customizable:
You can choose between 3 textures, 5 background colours and 5 button colours.

Navigation in main menu, press:
 * left or right to change game
 * up to increase level
 * down to increase speed
 * action button to start game
